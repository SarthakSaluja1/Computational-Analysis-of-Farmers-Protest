Social movements are one of biggest drivers of democracy, social justice, and equality in nations
across the world. It is a key instrument to bring about systematic revolutionary changes in
regimes and create a sense of conscience within communities. The advent of social media has
exponentially increased the avenues available to people to express grievances related to events,
policies, and norms. Using Twitter data, this paper attempts to evaluate the in-groups within a
framework of influence using the case of Farmers Protests in India. Network Analysis is used to
create hierarchical groups of protests based on increasing connectivity, whereas Text Analysis
and Vector Autoregression is used to adjudicate which groups are more likely to lead or follow
frames of Farmers Protests on Twitter. The results indicate that while users in the denser shells
tend to be more active (in terms of frequency of tweets), the peripheral groups also generate high
levels of activity, on an aggregate level. Further, both groups can lead discussions in different
topics. Using novel identification and estimation techniques, this research attempts to contribute
to larger field of communication patterns of social protests on social media platforms, and the
dynamics between influence of actors during information exchange.
